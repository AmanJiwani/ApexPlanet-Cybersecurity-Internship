# Nslookup Notes
- Command used: nslookup google.com
- Purpose: To find **IP addresses and DNS information** for a domain.

## Output Explanation:
- Server: 192.168.0.1 → The DNS server used by Kali to resolve the domain.
- Non-authoritative answer → The DNS server returned info from cached or other DNS, not the main authoritative server.
- Name: google.com → Domain we queried.
- Address: 216.58.203.46 → IPv4 address of google.com
- Address: 2404:6800:4009:80f::2000 → IPv6 address of google.com

## Observations:
- Domain resolves to both IPv4 and IPv6 addresses.
- Shows how a domain name translates to IPs, which is needed for connecting to the server.

## Why Important:
- Attackers can use this info to **identify target IPs**, map networks, or plan attacks like port scanning or exploitation.
- In the lab, we replace public domains with VM IPs like 192.168.56.102 for safe practice.
