# Cybersecurity Basics  

This document covers the **fundamentals of cybersecurity** including the **CIA Triad**, common **threats**, and **attack vectors**.

## üîë CIA Triad  

The **CIA Triad** is the foundation of cybersecurity.  

1. **Confidentiality**  
   - Ensures information is **accessible only to authorized users**.  
   - Techniques: Encryption, Access Control, Multi-factor Authentication (MFA).  

2. **Integrity**  
   - Protects data from being **altered or tampered with**.  
   - Techniques: Hashing, Digital Signatures, Checksums.  

3. **Availability**  
   - Ensures systems and data are **accessible when needed**.  
   - Techniques: Redundancy, Backups, DDoS Protection.  

üìå Together, the CIA Triad helps organizations balance security, usability, and resilience.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Common Cybersecurity Threats  

| Threat Type              | Description | Example |
|---------------------------|-------------|---------|
| **Malware**              | Malicious software designed to disrupt or damage systems. | Viruses, Worms, Trojans, Ransomware |
| **Phishing**             | Fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive info via emails/messages. | Fake bank emails |
| **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM)** | Attacker intercepts communication between two parties. | Fake Wi-Fi hotspot |
| **Denial-of-Service (DoS/DDoS)** | Flooding a server/network to make it unavailable. | Botnet attacks |
| **Insider Threats**      | Employees or contractors misusing access. | Data theft by staff |
| **Zero-Day Exploits**    | Attacks exploiting unknown vulnerabilities. | Newly discovered software flaw |

## üõ†Ô∏è Attack Vectors  

Attack vectors are **pathways attackers use to exploit systems**.  

### 1. **Network-based Vectors**  
- Open ports, weak firewalls, insecure Wi-Fi.  
- Example: Exploiting vulnerable services via Nmap scan.  

### 2. **Web-based Vectors**  
- Insecure applications & APIs.  
- Example: SQL Injection, Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).  

### 3. **Email & Social Engineering**  
- Trick users into revealing information or installing malware.  
- Example: Phishing, Spear Phishing.  

### 4. **Physical Vectors**  
- Direct access to devices or systems.  
- Example: USB drop attack.  

### 5. **Supply Chain Vectors**  
- Compromise through third-party vendors or software updates.  
- Example: SolarWinds attack.

## üìå Summary  

- **CIA Triad** ‚Üí Foundation of cybersecurity (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability).  
- **Threats** ‚Üí Malware, phishing, insider threats, zero-days, etc.  
- **Attack Vectors** ‚Üí Network, web, email/social, physical, supply chain.  

‚úÖ Understanding these basics is the **first step in becoming a cybersecurity professional**.
