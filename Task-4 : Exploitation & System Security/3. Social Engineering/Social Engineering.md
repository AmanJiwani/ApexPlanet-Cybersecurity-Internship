# Social Engineering (Simulation Only) — Internship Task

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Author:** Aman Jiwani (intern)
**Context:** Internship task — simulated phishing engagement for awareness training and defensive verification. **This exercise was performed in a controlled lab environment using NexPhisher and local hosting. No real users or production systems were targeted.**

---

## Executive summary

This document records a phishing simulation performed as part of an internship task. The simulation used NexPhisher to create an Instagram classic-login phishing page, hosted locally, and captured a simulated username/password when the lab user submitted credentials. The goal was to demonstrate how easy credential-capture can be when users are unaware, and to produce awareness training materials that teach detection and prevention techniques.

**Important legal & ethical note:** Phishing simulations must only be performed with explicit authorization and within scope (e.g., internal red-team exercises, authorized lab rooms like TryHackMe, or with consenting participants). Never use these techniques against real users or services without written permission.

## 1) Create a phishing simulation page (NexPhisher)

**Tool used:** NexPhisher (open-source phishing toolkit for lab/simulation).

### Steps performed (summary)

1. Launched NexPhisher and selected the `Instagram` template.
2. Chose the **Classic Login** Instagram template (creates a lookalike login page).
3. Configured hosting to `localhost` and used local port mapping (noted in this lab as `127.0.0.1:5555` — the lab command used `localhost127.0.0.01:5.5.5.5` which maps conceptually to local host and port; in practice use `127.0.0.1:5555`).
4. NexPhisher generated the `instagram` HTML page and the backend listener that logs submitted credentials.
5. Opened the phishing URL locally and submitted a test username/password to validate that NexPhisher captured the credentials.

### Example NexPhisher interaction (illustrative)

```bash
# start nexphisher (example)
./nexphisher.sh

# follow the menu prompts:
# 1) Socials -> Instagram -> Classic login
# set host: 127.0.0.1
# set port: 5555
# start server

# open browser: http://127.0.0.1:5555/instagram.html
# submit test credentials
# check nexphisher logs for captured credentials
```

### Evidence captured (example output)

```
[+] New credentials captured:
    username: testuser
    password: Password123
    source: 127.0.0.1
    time: 2025-10-18 12:34:56
```

**Interpretation:** The phishing page successfully captured submitted credentials in the lab environment, demonstrating the mechanics of credential capture.

## 2) Awareness training for phishing detection

**Objective:** Convert the simulation findings into practical awareness training that teaches users to recognise and resist phishing attempts.

### Training outline (recommended for a ~20–30 minute session)

1. **What is phishing?** (2–3 minutes)

   * Definition: fraudulent attempts to obtain sensitive information by pretending to be a trustworthy entity.
   * Common goals: credential theft, malware delivery, financial fraud.

2. **Anatomy of a phishing page** (5 minutes)

   * Visual cues: URL mismatches, poor grammar/typos, inconsistent branding.
   * Technical cues: HTTP vs HTTPS, certificate details, questionable hostnames (IP addresses in URL), unexpected redirects.
   * Behavioral cues: unsolicited requests for credentials, urgent language, pressure to act now.

3. **Live demo (simulated)** (5–7 minutes)

   * Show the locally-hosted phishing page (no real service involved).
   * Demonstrate captured credentials (anonymized test data) to illustrate the immediate consequence.

4. **How to verify** (3–5 minutes)

   * Inspect the URL carefully (hover over links, check the domain).
   * Check for HTTPS and valid certificate details (click the padlock).
   * Never enter credentials after following a link in unsolicited email/DM.
   * Use official apps or bookmarked sites for login.

5. **Protective measures** (3–5 minutes)

   * Use multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all important accounts.
   * Use a password manager — it will only auto-fill on legitimate domains.
   * Report suspected phishing to security team / platform.

6. **Interactive exercise / quiz** (5 minutes)

   * Show 4–6 real vs phishing examples; ask trainees to identify which are malicious.
   * Reward correct answers and explain red flags for incorrect ones.

7. **Wrap-up & resources**

   * Provide a one‑page quick checklist to save and follow.
   * Share contacts for reporting ([security@company.example](mailto:security@company.example)) and links to vendor guidance.

### Sample one-page checklist (to hand out)

* Don’t click links in unexpected emails or DMs.
* Hover over links and inspect destination domains.
* Check for HTTPS and certificate ownership.
* Don’t enter credentials on pages opened from emails — instead use bookmarks.
* If asked to do something urgent (send money, reset password), double-check via an independent channel.
* Report suspicious messages immediately.

## Ethical & safety notes (must include in internship report)

* Mark this task as **"Simulation — lab only"** in the internship submission.
* Include the TryHackMe/authorized-lab room or written authorization references (if used), and the date/time and scope of the test.
* Redact or anonymize any real user data. Use only test accounts or consenting participants.
* Include remediation advice and an incident handling checklist in case a real user falls for a live test (isolate, reset credentials, notify, rotate tokens, perform forensic capture).

## Artifacts & commands (copy/paste)

```bash
# Example NexPhisher startup (illustrative)
cd ~/tools/NexPhisher
./nexphisher.sh
# follow prompts: Socials -> Instagram -> Classic login
# host: 127.0.0.1
# port: 5555

# Open browser to test (lab only):
http://127.0.0.1:5555/instagram.html

# Check nexphisher logs for captured credentials (file or console depending on setup)
cat logs/credentials.txt
```

---

## Recommendations for the final internship report

1. Clearly label this as **Social Engineering (Simulation Only)** with scope and authorization.
2. Attach sanitized screenshots: NexPhisher menu, the phishing page, captured-test-credentials (anonymized), and the training checklist.
3. Provide timestamps and the lab environment IP/host used (e.g., `127.0.0.1:5555`) and note that the simulation never contacted real Instagram servers.
4. Describe next steps: deploy awareness training across team, enable MFA, and run periodic simulated phishing campaigns with HR/security coordination.
