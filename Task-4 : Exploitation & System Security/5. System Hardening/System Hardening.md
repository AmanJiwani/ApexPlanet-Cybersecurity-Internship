# System Hardening — Internship Task

**Date:** 2025-10-18
**Author:** Aman Jiwani (intern)
**Scope:** Apply basic system hardening techniques on a Linux VM in a controlled lab environment. This exercise demonstrates patching, firewall configuration, and disabling unused services.

---

## 1) Apply security patches

**Objective:** Ensure the system is up-to-date with latest security updates.

### Commands executed

```bash
# update package index
sudo apt update

# upgrade installed packages to latest versions
sudo apt upgrade -y
```

**Result:** All packages updated to latest available versions. Security vulnerabilities from outdated packages mitigated.

## 2) Configure firewall to block malicious traffic

**Tool:** `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall)

### Commands executed

```bash
# check current firewall status
sudo ufw verbose

# default policy: deny incoming, allow outgoing
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing

# enable firewall
sudo ufw enable

# verify status
sudo ufw status verbose
```

**Result:** Incoming connections are blocked by default, outgoing traffic allowed, firewall active and logging verbose. This helps block unauthorized access attempts.

### Notes

* Firewall rules can be customized further for specific services.
* Example: allow only HTTP/HTTPS ports if web server is needed:

```bash
sudo ufw allow 80/tcp
sudo ufw allow 443/tcp
```

## 3) Disable unused services

**Objective:** Reduce attack surface by stopping unnecessary services.

### Commands executed

```bash
# stop SSH service (for lab demonstration, ensure not connected remotely)
sudo systemctl stop ssh

# disable SSH to prevent it from starting on boot
sudo systemctl disable ssh
```

**Result:** SSH service stopped and disabled, reducing potential entry points for attackers.

### Notes & cautions

* Only stop services not required for system operation. Stopping SSH on a remote server will disconnect your session.
* Verify running services using:

```bash
sudo systemctl list-units --type=service --state=running
```

## Recommendations for production hardening

1. Apply security patches regularly (automate with unattended-upgrades if appropriate).
2. Configure firewall rules according to service needs; deny all unnecessary ports.
3. Disable or remove unused services to minimize attack surface.
4. Monitor logs and firewall events for suspicious activity.
5. Consider additional hardening: configure fail2ban, enable SELinux/AppArmor, enforce strong password policies, and perform regular vulnerability scans.
